I\u2019ve been a social and economic activist for many years, and I heard that he was at this town hall, just minutes after I got off work. I left in such a hurry that I didn\u2019t even have money for the toll -- I had to leave an IOU instead. I was desperate to speak to him because my community had suffered so much, and I held onto the hope that he would hear me. Instead of cooking dinner for my youngest son, yet again, I went on a mission to beg for my children\u2019s future. I wanted them to have clean water, clean air, and a stable economic future. I was especially frustrated because the most-polluting coal baron in West Virginia, Jim Justice, became my Democratic Governor. His mountaintop removal coal-mining operation is just three miles from my house, and continues to put silica dust in the air and my childrens\u2019 lungs daily.\n\n---\n\n###When I approach my Senator, I told him about the water pollution, air pollution, and the fact that I buried most of my family because of coal mining with diseases like black lung and cancer. I told him that we all deserved clean and safe jobs. \n\n---\n\n\u201cWe would have to agree to disagree\u201d he told me, as he tried to bid the coal miners in the crowd against me. When I told him about my family dying, he turned to them and said they needed jobs -- as if that was more important than their own safety, and their families and surrounding communities being poisoned and dying.\n\nNot only did he act like he was immune to my struggle as a coal miner\u2019s daughter, he tried to divide and turn our community against one another. We shouldn\u2019t have to fight each other for basic human rights like clean water, clean air and have access to jobs to provide for our families.Little did Joe know that the coal miners in the crowd met and stood with me afterwards, and we talked about real solutions -- not just slogans.\n\nA month earlier, Sen. Manchin taunted voters to kick him out of office if they didn\u2019t like what he was up to. \u201cWhat you ought to do is vote me out. Vote me out! I\u2019m not changing. Find somebody else who can beat me and vote me out,\u201d he said. So, after my encounter with the Senator, I decided to take him up on his challenge -- I was going to take his seat from him, and return representation to the people of West Virginia.\n\nLike most of my generation I was born a coal miner\u2019s daughter and granddaughter. I have lived most of my life watching the progression and regression of coal. I have witnessed\nfirst-hand the impact it has on our health and communities. I have in lived poverty and in prosperity. I have tasted polluted water. I have enjoyed some of the cleanest water in the world -- that no longer exists. I have dealt with the suffering of burying family members far too soon and too young. I have lived in cancer-clustered communities. I live with the worry that my children will get cancer. I have watched my neighbors suffer on their way to the same fate. I can\u2019t help but feel overwhelmed with the frustration of what will happen to the people of Appalachia.\n\nThe promise of coal means more pollution, more cancer, and more black lung. The companies are still blowing up our mountains, burying our streams, destroying our heritage and devaluing our quality of life. We have no promise of a stable economic future with the market for coal being down. It has always been an unreliable and unstable economic resource. As many communities are forced to live in conditions comparable to a third-world country, people fear how they are going to provide for their families. No man or woman should have to choose between poisoning one child and feeding another.\n\nIt\u2019s past time to end the fear that divides us. We need to start standing up for each other. There are alternatives. We can invest in a diverse economy. I, for one, don\u2019t want my children to\ninherit the struggles that we have had to endure. \n\nI\u2019m proud to be a [Justice Democrat](http://www.justicedemocrats.com?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=PaulaJean&utm_campaign=AMA0801) and a [Brand New Congress](http://www.brandnewcongress.org?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=PaulaJean&utm_campaign=AMA0801) candidate.

I'll continue asking him things as we're able - there are a lot to go through, but I and we appreciate the interest so much - every time I update him about the number of upvotes, his face lights up :)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSome people have been requesting pictures, so here they are:  [https://imgur.com/a/0yz41Nq](https://imgur.com/a/0yz41Nq) \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhile we're here and this has so much visibility (wow), I've gotta put this out there, cause I'd really love to have the opportunity to live as long as my grandpa has: WE NEED CLIMATE ACTION!!! We are currently headed down a very dangerous path, due to the fault of the super-wealthy who have gotten rich off of fossil fuels and extractive industries and covered up the negative consequences that will have a disproportionate harmful effect on poor people both in the future and now (BOOOO). While the situation is dire, THERE IS HOPE!!! But only if we come together and take an ACTIVE role in politics - local, state, and national - pushing for climate solutions! The easiest way to do this is, of course, to get good people into office who will push for climate justice so we don't have to be in the streets all the time, so vote responsibly - make sure that human isn't just greenwashing while still taking money from fossil fuel industry, but is taking REAL action (coughBERNIEandAOCareGREATcough)! And, if you are able, please please PLEASE join a climate justice organization, or donate to one - it has given me a great sense of community and solace being in the Sunrise Movement, being around people who are scared about the future just like me and learning about what to do about it together - it's been a truly transformative influence in my life, and I am so thankful for that. Links below for some organizations I like (but there are definitely others, so please, look them up and find one right for you!) (note: while my grandpa is not super hip about all the aspects of climate change, I have shared my life with him and he has been super supportive of me in my journey of action, and for that I am so grateful) JOIN, TAKE ACTION, SUPPORT THE GREEN NEW DEAL, AND/OR DONATE PLEASE, I WANT US ALL TO LIVE AS LONG AS MY GRANDPA <3\n\n[https://www.sunrisemovement.org/](https://www.sunrisemovement.org/)\n\n[https://rebellion.earth/](https://rebellion.earth/)\n\nthicc list:  [https://www.usclimatenetwork.org/member-organizations](https://www.usclimatenetwork.org/member-organizations)", "subscribers": 20894512, "subreddit": "IAmA"}, {"author": "wamandajd", "title": "I'm the Monopoly Man that trolled Equifax -- AMA!", "score": 80420, "id": "74nyxw", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/74nyxw/im_the_monopoly_man_that_trolled_equifax_ama/", "comms_num": 5744, "timestamp": "2017-10-06T22:31:09+00:00", "body": "I am a lawyer, activist, and professional troublemaker that photobombed former Equifax CEO Richard Smith in his Senate Banking hearing (https://twitter.com/wamandajd).

To quote from my memoir, \"I am a survivor of Nazi Germany during WW2. During my childhood I had to live 2 lives: a false public one as a loyal Nazi and my true one at home as a Jewish child in an anti-fascist family.\" Though both of my legal parents were German citizens, by biological father was Jewish. My family was always very open and accepting of others, and did not support fascism (but did what they needed to to survive). During WW2, we kept my heritage a secret. As a result, I was raised in the Hitler youth and trained as an anti-aircraft soldier. I was quite tall and desirable to the SS, but I had no interest in becoming one of them, so I volunteered to be in the anti-tank division once I was old enough to enlist.\n\nThough I fought as a German, I never believed in the war and waited for an opportunity to desert. When I was 17 a group of like-minded soldiers and I deserted and became POW in a British camp for 7 months.\n\nWhen the war ended, I returned to the secret family business of smuggling. The economic depression post-WW2 created an opportunity for my family to make money by illegally importing goods from surrounding countries (e.g. women's stockings from France). During this time I married my wife and had my first daughter.\n\nIn 1955, my wife, daughter, and I moved to Montreal, Canada. I worked any job I could get, including work as a butcher (even though I was not trained as one), a gas station attendant, and a candy maker. In 1958 we moved to Thunder Bay where I worked in a factory, then as a logger. There I had 3 more children.\n\nMy family and I eventually moved to Thompson, Manitoba so I could work in the mine. We had a good standard of living there (my wife was quite happy). We had a brand new home and plenty of extra income, but I saw no future for my children there. I lied to my wife, saying I had secured a job at the Britannia Beach mine and moved the entire family across Canada to Squamish, BC. I did end up getting a job in the mine, where I worked for a few months (until they went on strike). After that I worked in a pulp and paper mill (Woodfibre) for 25 years until my retirement.\n\nMy wife passed away from cancer in 2001. Since then I have traveled extensively, remarried, and am living happily in BC. I recently wrote a book about my life and you can find it here: [https://www.amazon.ca/FEARLESS-Jewish-boy-Nazi-Germany/dp/1674561202/ref=sr\\_1\\_4?keywords=fearless&qid=1578004297&sr=8-4](https://www.amazon.ca/FEARLESS-Jewish-boy-Nazi-Germany/dp/1674561202/ref=sr_1_4?keywords=fearless&qid=1578004297&sr=8-4)\n\nUSA link here :  [https://www.amazon.com/FEARLESS-Jewish-boy-Nazi-Germany/dp/1674561202/ref=sr\\_1\\_6?keywords=middelmann&qid=1578093209&sr=8-6](https://www.amazon.com/FEARLESS-Jewish-boy-Nazi-Germany/dp/1674561202/ref=sr_1_6?keywords=middelmann&qid=1578093209&sr=8-6)\n\nHello Reddit, I am Roberts grand-daughter. I will be helping him with this post, by asking him your questions and writing his responses. He would like to add that this post makes it sound like his life was a lot more smooth and pre-planned than it was. His life was a lot more 'by the seat of his pants' than this suggests.\n\nBelow we have attached some photos from his life\n\n[https://imgur.com/6HHns4T](https://imgur.com/6HHns4T)\n\n[https://imgur.com/YXmbbvv](https://imgur.com/YXmbbvv)\n\n[https://imgur.com/r8CXl4g](https://imgur.com/r8CXl4g)\n\n[https://imgur.com/M293MDR](https://imgur.com/M293MDR)\n\n[https://imgur.com/33gdQDW](https://imgur.com/33gdQDW)\n\n[https://imgur.com/xKS6AoK](https://imgur.com/xKS6AoK)\n\n[https://imgur.com/NOhWVL6](https://imgur.com/NOhWVL6)\n\n[https://imgur.com/8lR9RkT](https://imgur.com/8lR9RkT)\n\nNSFW [https://imgur.com/t0VDnVX](https://imgur.com/t0VDnVX)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*\\* EDIT 1\\*\\*\\*\n\nHello everyone, thanks for the overwhelming amount of responses. We are going to stop answering questions for now but we might try and answer some of the bigger ones in the next couple days, when I (grand-daughter) am able to get together with Robert again.\n\nAlso, to people wondering how someone who had a Jewish father, who was killed for being a Jew, could be alive (since the Germans would have killed the whole family). Simply put, Robert's biological father and legal father are two different people. His biological father was one of his neighbors and worked as a sales manager for the family.  Robert found out at 4 years old, but he was still raised to be his legal father's son.\n\n\\*\\*\\*EDIT 2\\*\\*\\*\n\nRobert has asked me (granddaughter) to add his reflections on all the comments he has either read or responded to:\n\nI\u2019d like to thank everyone for their questions and comments, even the ones who insulted me. I am able to understand them. Most of your questions are answered in my memoir, \u201cFEARLESS\u201d \u201cA Jewish boy in Nazi Germany.\u201d I would like to clarify a few things for those who have read my profile. My family was totally opposed to Hitler and the Nazi regime. During the war we risked our lives to help those who were being persecuted by the Nazis. After the war I reconnected with some holocaust survivors who I had helped and were my friends. In 1944 Hitler was losing the war and students were forced to join in the fight. Our entire grade 10 class of 15 and 16-year-old students were placed in the anti-aircraft units. Soon I was made to join the tank division and after my training I was being sent on a suicide mission to blow up allied tanks. In order to avoid this I smashed my foot with a 100 pound boulder. I wanted the allies to win as I saw them as our liberators from an evil and brutal regime. I am very thankful that I escaped armed combat and never killed anyone during the war. It has been estimated that 150,000 Jews or partial Jews served in Hitler\u2019s military. I was one of them.", "subscribers": 20894512, "subreddit": "IAmA"}]
