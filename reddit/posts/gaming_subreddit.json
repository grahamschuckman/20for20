Played the beta of Star Wars battlefront 2 and you still can't just get in a vehicle, it feels so fake. Why is Rey in the clone wars!? That is all bad, but EA have just totally taken the piss with abusing Star Wars fans and cutting their games into little pieces and bleeding the fan base dry. \n\nI've had enough. \n\n#boycottswbf2\n\n#boycottea\n\nEdit 1: Spelt Rey wrong sorry! Autocorrect and I didn't check.\n\nEdit 2: Thank you so very much for the support that this post has received, it really has been quite overwhelming. This post is very much a quick outpouring of thoughts of mine rather then a well thought through argument focusing on the main issues with EA's Star Wars Battlefront 2. I only eluded to the main issues, rather than outright stating the unacceptable issues with loot boxes, progression grind, the pay to win aspects and the short campaign etc. However people who are on this sub reddit are very much aware of the main issues.\n\nAll I hope that this post has managed to bring attention to the main issues and bring about some positive change.  \n\nEdit 3: Thank you kind strangers for the reddit gold!\n\nEdit 4: EA have a pattern of this behaviour so I have added the boycott EA hashtag.
