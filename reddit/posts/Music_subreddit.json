We\u2019re protesting nationwide on Dec 7th to stop them.\nHead over to http://www.verizonprotests.com/ for more info.**\n\n**WHAT\u2019S HAPPENING?**\nThe Federal Communications Commission (FCC) just [announced](https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20171120/11253438653/fcc-plan-to-use-thanksgiving-to-hide-attack-net-neutrality-vastly-underestimates-looming-backlash.shtml) its plan to slash net neutrality rules, allowing ISPs like Verizon to block apps, slow websites, and charge fees to control what you see & do online. They vote December 14th. People from across the political spectrum are outraged, so we\u2019re planning to protest at Verizon retail stores across the country on December 7, one week before the vote and at the peak of the busy Holiday shopping season. We'll demand that our members of Congress take action to stop Verizon's puppet FCC from killing net neutrality.\n\n**WHAT\u2019S NET NEUTRALITY?**\nNet neutrality is the [basic principle](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/05/the-case-for-rebooting-the-network-neutrality-debate/361809/) that has made the Internet into what it is today. It prevents big Internet Service Providers (like Verizon) from charging extra fees, engaging in censorship, or controlling what we see and do on the web by throttling websites, apps, and online services.\n\n**WHY VERIZON STORES?**\nThe new chairman of the FCC, Ajit Pai, is a former top lawyer for Verizon, and the company has been spending millions on [lobbying](https://www.theverge.com/2017/7/12/15959932/comcast-verizon-att-net-neutrality-day-of-action) and lawsuits to kill net neutrality so they can gauge us all for more money. By protesting at Verizon stores, we\u2019re shining light on the corruption and demanding that our local do something about it. Only Congress has the power to stop Verizon's puppet FCC, so at the protests we'll be calling and tweeting at legislators, and in cities where it's possible we'll march from Verizon stores to lawmakers offices.\n\n**WHAT ARE OUR DEMANDS?**\nAjit Pai is clearly still working for Verizon, not the public. But he still has to answer to Congress. So we\u2019re calling on our lawmakers to do their job overseeing the FCC and speak out against Ajit Pai\u2019s plan to gut Title II net neutrality protections and give Verizon and other giant ISPs everything on their holiday wishlist. \n\n**HOW CAN I JOIN?**\n[Click here](https://events.battleforthenet.com/#eventType=protestrally) and you\u2019ll find an interactive map where you can see if there is already a protest planned near you.

The most effective way to can stop this is by driving as many calls as possible to our Senators and Representatives, now through Nov. 22nd. ](https://www.battleforthenet.com)**\n\nWe're getting word that there are lawmakers who are sympathetic to our cause and considering taking action to slow the FCC down, but they won\u2019t act unless they get more phone calls from constituents. Also, if your think your Rep's opposed to net neutrality, its all the more reason to call them. Those Reps need to hear your voice more than anyone.\n\n**Please, head over to https://www.battleforthenet.com , and give your Senators and Reps a call telling them to stop the FCC from slashing Title II net neutrality protections.** The time to act is now.\n\nTo reach the call in line directly by phone, **call 202-930-8550**.\n\nWhen you get through to your Rep's office, introduce yourself, be polite, and say: \n> I support \"Title Two\" net neutrality rules and I urge you to oppose the FCC's plan to repeal them. Specifically, I'd like you to contact the FCC Chairman and demand he abandon his current plan.\n\nWe also have ready-made banners, modals, and graphics of various sizes here: https://www.battleforthenet.com/#join\n\nThanks.", "subscribers": 28310551, "subreddit": "Music"}, {"author": "DaFunkJunkie", "title": "Right-wing fans mocked for boycotting Rage Against the Machine after realising band\u2019s political stance", "score": 96240, "id": "h0l06d", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/news/rage-against-the-machine-right-wing-conservatives-politics-boycott-tom-morello-a9558241.html", "comms_num": 7573, "timestamp": "2020-06-10T21:43:43+00:00", "body": "", "subscribers": 28310551, "subreddit": "Music"}, {"author": "rel4th", "title": "Linkin Park singer Chester Bennington passes away aged 41", "score": 90072, "id": "6oi3ze", "url": "http://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/chester-bennington-linkin-park-dead-10840345", "comms_num": 7559, "timestamp": "2017-07-20T18:16:16+00:00", "body": "", "subscribers": 28310551, "subreddit": "Music"}, {"author": "mexicanland", "title": "Chance The Rapper is starting a new awards show for teachers", "score": 87246, "id": "6yirqe", "url": "http://www.avclub.com/chance-the-rapper-is-starting-a-new-awards-show-for-tea-1798729455", "comms_num": 1950, "timestamp": "2017-09-06T21:45:45+00:00", "body": "", "subscribers": 28310551, "subreddit": "Music"}, {"author": "CapitalCourse", "title": "Miley Cyrus\u2019 \u201cParty In The U.S.A.,\u201d NSYNC\u2019s \u201cBye Bye Bye\u201d suddenly charting for some reason", "score": 85280, "id": "jqnl1p", "url": "https://news.avclub.com/miley-cyrus-party-in-the-u-s-a-nsyncs-bye-bye-bye-1845608359", "comms_num": 1894, "timestamp": "2020-11-09T00:54:45+00:00", "body": "", "subscribers": 28310551, "subreddit": "Music"}, {"author": "CremasterFlash", "title": "40 year old rock station in Chicago replaced by Christian radio at midnight last night.
